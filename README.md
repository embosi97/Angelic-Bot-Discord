# Angelic-Bot-Discord
Token has been changed by discord themselves so modifying the bot won't change the bot in a discord I'm in. 

Functionality:

The inspirational quotes come from this API https://zenquotes.io

$pray - Makes the bot say an inspirational quote.

$rules - States all the functionality.

$responding - Disables or enables the bot.

$new - Allows the user to add to the Angelic Bot's responses to certain key words.

$del - Deletes a user submitted quote.

$demon - Makes the bot say something truly mean-sprited that's been zalgofied using the zalgofy module.

$list - Lists all the user submitted quotes.

This bot is powered by https://uptimerobot.com/, which allows the bot to work even if I close the program.
